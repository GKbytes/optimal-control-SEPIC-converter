# Optimal Controllers for SEPIC converter
Design and simulation optimal controllers for SEPIC converter. Used Model Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE) for recovering the states. Compare two controllers:  A linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and  a predictive control (MPC) .  The calculations made on Matlab, and simulated on Simulink
